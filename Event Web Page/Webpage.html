        These days, people dress to suit their tastes, styles, and preferences. They also consider new trends seriously and adhere to them obsessively. Fashion is determined by how individuals in a given state or region choose to dress, and it can differ greatly from one nation to the next.

        Even though clothes are the primary focus when discussing fashion, other accessories like jewellery, purses, shoes, and eyewear can also play a significant role.
